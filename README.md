# CTSimU Software Toolbox

The CTSimU Software Toolbox is a set of Python modules that can be accessed from a Python script to run several image processing and analysis routines that are needed in the WIPANO CTSimU project. The software comes as a Python package which provides an interface to an image processing pipeline. Processing steps can be added to this pipeline, which will then run each step sequentially on all input images and save them as new output images.

This is the source code for the CTSimU Software Toolbox. Please refer to the **[documentation](https://bamresearch.github.io/ctsimu-toolbox-docs/)** to get started.
