# CTSimU Software Toolbox

The CTSimU Software Toolbox is a set of Python modules to run several image processing and analysis routines that are common in computed tomography (CT). It provides an interface to an image processing pipeline. Processing steps can be added to this pipeline, which will then run each step sequentially on all input images and save them as new output images. The toolbox also provides objects for manipulating a virtual CT scene.
